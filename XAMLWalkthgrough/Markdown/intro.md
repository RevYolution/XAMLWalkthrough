# Intro for XAML

### What is XAML?
- E***X***tensible ***A***pplication ***M***arkup ***L***anguage (XAML) allows the UI of a Xamarin.Forms app to be seperate from the behavior of the aoo.
- Ideal for complex applications so to be able to interact with the UI and behavior independently

#### XAML Benefits
- Separates UI and behavior code
- XAML is a markup language
- Elements are described with predefined tags
- These tags have specific meaning in the context of the domain
- Markup languages are normally interpreted by other software tools. XAML is used this way to produce the app UI
- XAML is a declarative markup language from Microsoft to simplify the creation of UI in applications
- XAML docs contain elemts that declaratively descirbe the UI elements. These are direct instantiations of the objects. This allows access to the objects in code-behind files so behavior can be defined using C#.
